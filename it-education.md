# IT Education Path for Kids

## Main path

### Talk about how the world works

Talk with you kids about the world.

Recommended age: 2+

Recommended topics:
- Cutting the pizza – Intruce terminoloy like whole, half, quarter, eight...
- Games – Donino, Checkers, ...


### Robot Commander

Use direct commands to command the rebot. 
Do not use computers yet.

Recommended age: 2+


### DragonBox Algebra 5+

This is a game,therefore the kids will enjoy it. The game has rules that coincide with the rules that are used in algebra. When the kids get to algebra later in school, there will be nothing new to learn.

Recommended age: 5

### ScratchJr

In the first programming on a computer the kids will create simpe animations and games.

Recommended age: 5-7

### Scratch

The kids will be able to create any program, in an easy way.

Recommended age: 8-16

### Python

First real programming language the kids will learn.

References:
- [Python for Kids – A Playful Introduction to Programming](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids)  this is the best book. However, I have some reservations regarding the programming methodology. (Basically, we should start with a problem, then explain the algorithm with words and code it in a programming language. Here the author jumps directly to Python.)

### Java or C#

These languages have other concepts the kids should internalize (like data types, classes...).

- TODO


### C

When learning the C language, the kids will learn about topics that are considered quite low level in 2019. These include: pointers, passing parameters by value or by reference...

- TODO


### Prolog or Haskell

So far the kids learned the procedural programming. There is another kind of programming called declarative programming. 


### Algorithms

The kids should learn about algorithms because knowing the algorithm is first and then expressing the algorithm in a programming language is second.

There are some tips:
- Sorting – includes, arrays, introduction to complexity, recursion (quicksort)
- Shortest path - graphs
- ...

### RoboRally

Board game in which you program your robot. The player gets cards with commands like left turn, go straight. The player puts the card in such an order to get his or her rogot the finish before other robots. plus there is shooting at other's robots, waypoints, conveyor belts... For 2 to 8 players, the game takes between 45 and 120 minutes.

Recommended age: 10+

## Other topics

### Web programming

To create anything reasonable on web, we need understand XML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and libraries. That's a large body of knowledge. Plus, to replicate something ("I want to create the same webpage") is difficult.

I recommend doing this after Python.
