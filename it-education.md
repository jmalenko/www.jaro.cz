# IT Education Path for Kids

## Main path

### Talk about how the world works

Talk with you kids about the world.

Recommended age: 2+

Recommended topics:
- Cutting the pizza – Intruce terminoloy like whole, half, quarter, eight...
- Games – Donino, Checkers, ...
- Nontrivial talkting topics
  - Talk about ancestors, who they were, how they lived. (Scientific reason: [Knowing family history can be beneficial to children](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/03/living/telling-kids-family-history-benefits-feat/index.html).)
  
    A study involved asking children a range of questions such as whether they knew where their parents met and where they grew up and went to school. The authors found that the more children knew about their family history, the higher their self-esteem and the better able they were to deal with the effects of stress. Family stories provide a sense of identity through time, and help children understand who they are in the world.)
  - Bake together
- Have you heard "Dad, can you tell about X", where is X is still the same? OK, do that. Early take turns: first, parents tels the sotry; then the kid tells the same story (in simpler form, with own language).


### Robot Commander

Use direct commands to command the rebot. 
Do not use computers yet.

Recommended age: 2+

There are some tips:
- Phases
  - Kid is robot: Kid follows commands by adult
  - Adult is robot: Adult follows commands by kid
  - Start with "normally simple commands" - one step ahead, turn left, turn right
  - Do it again without "rurn right" (use "turn left" repeatedly)
  - Introduce errors – Commender: "one step ahead" Robot: "I cannot, there is no space"
  - Introduce conditions - "If you see a dog then bark"
  - Introduce cycles - "do 10 steps", "do steps until you reach the wall", "while the glass is not empty, do a sip"
  - Introduce events - "if someone enters the room, say 'Hello human'".


### Algorithms – initial steps

Before mentioning an algorithm, let's build some basics:
- the computer is quite stupid; it can only follow simple commands
- commands (statements), conditions, cycles
- termination, effectiveness

This always has a form of a game.

Recommended age: 3+

There are some tips:
- Robot Commander (see another chapter)
- [Paper Airplane Worksheet](https://code.org/curriculum/course2/2/Activity2-RealLifeAlgorithms.pdf) - put steps in order, handle the algorithm to a friend, watch him or her to build it
- [Teaching Graph Algorithms To Children Of All Ages](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254462782_Teaching_graph_algorithms_to_children_of_all_ages) – Graphs from beginning, ends with shortest path algorithm. Includes ideas (activities, questions...) for the teacher. Age 5–17.
- [Introducing Algorithms](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teachers/lesson-ideas/introducing-algorithms) – Color some fields in the grid such that we get a checkboard. Age 3-4.

### DragonBox Algebra 5+

This is a game,therefore the kids will enjoy it. The game has rules that coincide with the rules that are used in algebra. When the kids get to algebra later in school, there will be nothing new to learn.

Recommended age: 5

### ScratchJr

In the first programming on a computer the kids will create simpe animations and games.

Recommended age: 5-7

References:
- [ScratchJr website](https://www.scratchjr.org/)


### Scratch

The kids will be able to create any program, in an easy way.

Recommended age: 8-16

References:
- [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/about)


### Python

First real programming language the kids will learn.

References:
- [Python for Kids – A Playful Introduction to Programming](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) – This is the best book I've found. However, I have some reservations regarding the programming methodology. (Basically, we should start with a problem, then explain the algorithm with words and code it in a programming language. Here the author jumps directly to Python.)

### Algorithms 2 – serious introduction

There are several educational (basic and interesting) algortihms to start with.

Recommended age: ~8

There are some tips:
- [CS Unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/) ([older version](https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/), [printables](https://csunplugged.org/en/resources/)) – A collection of learning activities to teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. Each activity has a PDF with full instructions and worksheets.

There are some areas of Computer Science thats are suitable for kids:
- Sorting – includes: arrays, introduction to complexity, recursion (quicksort)
- Shortest path - graphs
- Combinatorics
- (Pseudo) Random number generators
- Encryption, cryptography
- ...

References:
- [Algorithm definition on Simple Wikipedia] (https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) – introductory, shows three different algortihms to the sorting
- [Algorithm definition in Kids Encyclopedia](http://encyclopedia.kids.net.au/page/al/Algorithm)


### Java or C#

These languages have other concepts the kids should internalize (like data types, classes...).

References:
- TODO


### C

When learning the C language, the kids will learn about topics that are considered quite low level in 2019. These include: pointers, passing parameters by value or by reference...

References:
- TODO


### Prolog or Haskell

So far the kids learned the procedural programming. There is another kind of programming called declarative programming. 


### Algorithms 3 – computer science

The kids should learn about algorithms because knowing the algorithm is first and then expressing the algorithm in a programming language is second.

Recommended age: ~12

There are some tips:
- Sorting – includes: arrays, introduction to complexity, recursion (quicksort)
- Shortest path - graphs
- ...

### RoboRally

Board game in which you program your robot. The player gets cards with commands like left turn, go straight. The player puts the card in such an order to get his or her rogot the finish before other robots. plus there is shooting at other's robots, waypoints, conveyor belts... For 2 to 8 players, the game takes between 45 and 120 minutes.

Recommended age: 10+

## Other topics

### Web programming

To create anything reasonable on web, we need understand XML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and libraries. That's a large body of knowledge. Plus, to replicate something ("I want to create the same webpage") is difficult.

I recommend doing this after Python.
